**Ender 3 V3 SE presets** for Orca/Prusa slicer created by **MD/YU7ZZZ**.

After few months of tweaking I've gotten to the point where most of the settings are basically perfect.

I have used only **Creality Hyper PLA** and some **generic** "Devil Design" **PET-G**, results are great with both.


Make sure to select printer configuration according to the material type you want to use first, filament should then be selected automatically and you'll have an option to choose between created process presets.


Only major hardware modification I have done to the printer is full ceramic **K1 hotend with unicorn nozzle** and part cooling dan is mounted to the side using [this shroud](https://www.printables.com/model/637754-ender-3-v3-se-lightweight-fan-shroud).
