# **Ender 3 V3 SE presets** for Orca/Prusa slicer created by **MD/YU7ZZZ**.

## Information
After few months of tweaking I've gotten to the point where most of the settings are basically perfect.

I have used  **Devil Design PLA**, **Creality Hyper PLA** and some **generic PET-G**, results are great with all.


Make sure to select printer configuration according to the material type you want to use first, filament should then be selected automatically and you'll have an option to choose between created process presets.

### Mods
Only major hardware modification I have done to the printer is full ceramic **K1 hotend with unicorn nozzle** and part cooling dan is mounted to the side using [this shroud](https://www.printables.com/model/637754-ender-3-v3-se-lightweight-fan-shroud).

[Over here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ender3V3SE/s/crWZ9WViXZ) you'll find photos of my OctoPi setup built into the printer itself, together with relay module for power control.
